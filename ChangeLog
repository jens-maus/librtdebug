	* CRTDebug.cpp: in case no pthread library is found librtdebug will
		now be compiled in "single-threaded" mode instead of refusing to
		compile at all.
	* misc: reworked the whole debugging interface to load its debugging
	  classes/flags via a user-defineable ENV variable. In addition, a
		filename matching facility has been added to make it also possible
		to specify a string pattern which, in case it matches, will
		suppress/show the debugging output in question.
		Now all debug flags/classes are fully configurable/supressable. In
		addition source files can be combined into so-called "debug modules"
		which can also be suppressed or explicitly showed.
